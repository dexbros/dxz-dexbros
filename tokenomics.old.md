## 3. Token Distribution & Initial Supply

Below is the **initial distribution** at TGE, expressed as a **percentage** of the **1.21T total**. A portion of tokens is allocated to each category, with vesting schedules to ensure long-term stability. This distribution **does not** include inflationary tokens that may be minted over time.

| **Category**                      | **Percentage** | **Tokens (SXT)**      | **Vesting / Release**                                       | **Rationale / Usage**                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | -------------: | --------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

### Notes on Distribution

- **Vesting Contracts**: Each allocation with a lock period or cliff is ideally managed through a **smart contract** vesting solution for transparency and trust.
- **Unallocated Reserve**: Gives flexibility for unforeseen needs or expansions; the DAO can decide how or if to deploy these tokens.

---

## 4. Inflation & Emission Model

Although 1.21T tokens are minted at TGE, the protocol allows **additional token issuance** over time:

1. **Base Inflation Rate**

   - **Year 1–2**: ~10% annual inflation, minted and distributed to validators, stakers, and social rewards.
   - **Year 3–4**: Taper down to ~8% annual inflation.
   - **Year 5+**: Stabilize around ~5% inflation (or subject to DAO vote).

2. **Dynamic Adjustment**

   - The DAO can **propose** adjusting the inflation curve each year based on network security needs, token demand, and overall market conditions.
   - A portion of fees or revenue might be burned to offset inflation (similar to EIP-1559).

3. **Emission Distribution**
   - **Staking/Validator Pool**: ~40–50% of newly minted tokens.
   - **Social Rewards**: ~30–40% to reward activity (likes, posts, user engagement).
   - **DAO Treasury**: ~10–20% for ongoing grants, ecosystem expansions, or buybacks/burn.

### Example Annual Breakdown

| **Year** | **Target Inflation** | **Staking & Validators** | **Social Activity Rewards** | **DAO / Treasury** |
| -------: | -------------------: | -----------------------: | --------------------------: | -----------------: |
|      1–2 |                  10% |            50% of minted |               40% of minted |      10% of minted |
|      3–4 |                   8% |            45% of minted |               40% of minted |      15% of minted |
|       5+ |        5% (variable) |            40% of minted |               40% of minted |      20% of minted |

## 5. Staking & Validator Framework

1. **Validator Eligibility**

   - Must stake a minimum of X SXT (decided by the DAO) to operate a validator node on the L2.
   - Nodes confirm L2 transactions, post fraud or validity proofs to Ethereum L1, etc.

2. **21-Day Unbonding Period**

   - Validators who wish to exit must lock tokens for **21 days** before withdrawing.
   - Reduces malicious behavior and ensures network stability.

3. **Reward Distribution**

   - Rewards are paid from:
     - **Base inflation** (as described in the Emission Model)
     - **Transaction fees** or partial fees from bridging and L2 activity
   - Example: 70% of fees go to validators, 30% is burned or sent to DAO.

4. **Slashing Mechanism (Optional)**
   - If a validator is caught misbehaving (double-signing, failing to provide proofs), a portion of their staked SXT can be slashed.
   - Encourages honest participation and robust security.

---

## 6. Social Activity Rewards (Social Mining)

1. **Proof-of-Engagement (PoE)**

   - The network measures genuine user interactions: upvotes, comments, watch time, NFT sales, etc.
   - A daily or weekly “activity snapshot” allocates a portion of newly minted tokens to the most engaged/valuable users.

2. **Reputation Scoring**

   - Weighted by user history, trust score, and content quality to prevent spam or exploitative farming.
   - New accounts may have a probation period or lower reward multiplier.

3. **Distribution Mechanism**
   - A **reward pool** replenished by the inflation schedule (e.g., 40% of minted tokens each year).
   - Rewards claimable each epoch or daily, with potential small lockups to discourage immediate dumping.

---

## 7. Governance & DAO Structure

1. **Progressive Decentralization**

   - **Phase 1**: Core team sets default parameters and actively steers development.
   - **Phase 2**: Early DAO forms to vote on major proposals (inflation rates, big partnerships).
   - **Phase 3**: Full on-chain governance, community-driven treasury management, and protocol upgrades.

2. **Voting Power**

   - Voting weight can be based on **staked tokens**, with an added **reputation factor** for active users.
   - Potential to use **Quadratic Voting** or other advanced models to prevent whale dominance.

3. **Proposal Lifecycle**
   - Submit proposal → Discussion & refinement → On-chain vote → Timelock for execution.

---

## 8. Revenue & Deflationary Mechanics

1. **Revenue Streams**

   - **Advertising**: Brands pay SXT or stablecoins for ad slots; a % is distributed to creators or stakers, or used to buy/burn SXT.
   - **Subscription Fees**: Premium features or ad-free experiences paid in SXT.
   - **NFT Market Fees**: A cut of transaction fees from NFT sales, portion can be burned or allocated to stakers.

2. **Deflationary Tools**
   - **Fee Burn**: A fraction of every L2 transaction fee is burned, offsetting inflation.
   - **Buybacks**: The DAO can use treasury funds (earned from ads, etc.) to repurchase tokens on the market and burn them, reducing circulating supply.

---

## 9. Roadmap & Phased Implementation

1. **Phase 0: Pre-TGE & Private Sale**

   - Secure seed funding, finalize token contracts, conduct audits.
   - Early partnerships and planning for L2 architecture.

2. **Phase 1: TGE & Public Launch**

   - Mint 1.21T SXT, distribute per table.
   - List on major DEX/CEX, bootstrap staking (small portion from initial pool).

3. **Phase 2: Full Staking & 21-Day Unbonding**

   - Implement robust validator/staking system with unbonding period.
   - Enable partial fee burn or EIP-1559-like mechanism on L2.
   - Launch simple Social Mining rewards.

4. **Phase 3: Advanced Social Features & DAO**

   - Expand “Proof-of-Engagement” reward system.
   - Roll out NFT marketplace, ad platform, subscription tiers.
   - Transition to on-chain governance for major protocol decisions.

5. **Phase 4: Mature Ecosystem & Decentralization**
   - Community-driven expansions, cross-chain integrations.
   - Possible adjustments to inflation based on usage metrics.
   - Achieve self-sustaining revenue from ads, subscriptions, NFT fees, etc.

## 10. Security & Audits

1. **Smart Contract Audits**
   - Token contract, vesting contracts, staking contracts, bridging logic all require **independent security audits**.
2. **Bug Bounty Programs**
   - Ongoing bounties to incentivize white-hat hackers to find vulnerabilities.
3. **Modular Upgrades**
   - Use proxy contracts or upgradable frameworks carefully, with governance oversight to prevent rug pulls.
