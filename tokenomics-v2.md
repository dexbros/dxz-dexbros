# Dexbros Token Unlocking & Vesting Schedule

## **Version:** 1.0
## **Network:** Ethereum L1 (Supply Governance) + L2 (Utility & Circulation)

---

## **📌 1. Introduction**

Dexbros ($DxBs) follows a structured unlocking and vesting mechanism designed to:

✔️ **Fair & Predictable Distribution** – Prevents token dumping and market instability.  
✔️ **Long-Term Incentive Alignment** – Core contributors, investors, and users benefit gradually.  
✔️ **Governance Oversight** – DAO-managed allocations for sustainability and decentralization.

At TGE (**Token Generation Event**), **1.21 trillion DxBs tokens** are minted on **Ethereum L1**, with controlled releases to **L2** for usage and circulation.

## **📌 5. Smart Contract Implementation & Address Registration**

### **Private Sale Unlocking Method:**
🔹 Investors’ addresses **will be registered manually post-deployment.**

✅ **Why Manual Registration?**
- Flexibility to add/change investor addresses **after TGE.**  
- Ensures compliance with **legal and KYC requirements.**  
- Allows **strategic token allocations** based on governance decisions.
