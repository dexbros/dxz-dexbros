# Dexbros Token Unlocking & Vesting Schedule

## **Version:** 1.0

## **Network:** Ethereum L1 (Supply Governance) + L2 (Utility & Circulation)

---

## **üìå 1. Introduction**

Dexbros ($DXZ) follows a structured unlocking and vesting mechanism designed to:

‚úîÔ∏è **Fair & Predictable Distribution** ‚Äì Prevents token dumping and market instability.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Long-Term Incentive Alignment** ‚Äì Core contributors, investors, and users benefit gradually.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Governance Oversight** ‚Äì DAO-managed allocations for sustainability and decentralization.

At TGE (**Token Generation Event**), **1.21 trillion DXZ tokens** are minted on **Ethereum L1**, with controlled releases to **L2** for usage and circulation.

---

## **üìå 2. Token Allocation & Unlocking Summary**

The **initial 1.21 trillion $DXZ** is divided across multiple allocations, each with a distinct vesting and unlocking schedule:

| **Category**                      | **% of Total Supply** | **Tokens (DXZ)** | **Unlocking & Vesting Schedule**                                       |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Private Sale / Seed Investors** | 12%                   | 145.2B             | **20% at TGE, cliff 9-month, remainder vests monthly over 24 months**                 |
| **Public Sale / IDO / IEO**       | 8%                    | 96.8B             | **25% at TGE, remainder vests linearly over 9 months**                 |
| **Team & Advisors**               | 15%                   | 181.5B            | **12-month cliff, then vests monthly over 36 months**                  |
| **Ecosystem & Partnerships**      | 10%                   | 121B              | **Fully locked at TGE, released via DAO proposals**                    |
| **Community & User Growth**       | 16%                   | 193.6B            | **Fully unlocked at TGE for immediate use**                            |
| **Staking & Validator Rewards**   | 7%                    | 84.7B             | **Gradual emission per block, transitions to inflation-based rewards** |
| **Liquidity & Market Making**     | 12%                   | 145.2B            | **30% unlocked at TGE, remainder released strategically by DAO**       |
| **Foundation / Treasury**         | 15%                   | 181.5B            | **DAO-controlled, unlocked based on proposals**                        |
| **Unallocated Reserve**           | 5%                    | 60.5B             | **TBD (Governance-controlled usage)**                                  |

---

## **üìå 3. Unlocking & Vesting Details Per Allocation**

### **üî¥ Liquidity & Market Making (12%)**
‚úÖ **30% unlocked at TGE.**  
‚úÖ **Remaining 70% is controlled by DAO for strategic release.**  
‚úÖ **Supports liquidity across multiple exchanges (DEX & CEX).**  
‚úÖ **Ensures market stability & prevents excessive volatility.**  

#### **Strategic Release Plan:**
- **DAO votes on liquidity release schedules.**
- **Considerations for multiple exchange listings.**
- **Funds for market-making partnerships to stabilize price action.**

---

## **üìå 4. Inflation-Based Minting (Post 16% Depletion)**

üìå Once the **Community & User Growth** pool is depleted:

- **0.75% inflation of total supply (1.21T DXZ) every 21 days.**
- **Supports staking, validator rewards, social incentives.**

#### **Example Timeline:**

| Cycle   | Total Supply | Inflation (0.75%) | New Circulating Supply |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Cycle 1 | 1.21T DXZ   | 9.075B DXZ     | 1.219T DXZ           |
| Cycle 2 | 1.219T DXZ | 9.075B DXZ    | 1.228T DXZ           |

---

## **üìå 5. Smart Contract Implementation & Address Registration**

### **Private Sale Unlocking Method:**
üîπ Investors‚Äô addresses **will be registered manually post-deployment.**  
üîπ Smart contract will release tokens based on the **vesting schedule.**  
üîπ DAO can **update investor addresses if required.**  

‚úÖ **Why Manual Registration?**
- Flexibility to add/change investor addresses **after TGE.**  
- Ensures compliance with **legal and KYC requirements.**  
- Allows **strategic token allocations** based on governance decisions.

---

## **üìå 6. Governance Control & Adjustments**

‚úîÔ∏è **The DAO can vote to:**  
- Adjust inflation rate (if necessary).  
- Reallocate locked token pools.  
- Burn excess supply to control inflation.  
- Adjust liquidity release schedules based on exchange needs.

---

## **üìå 7. Summary**

‚úîÔ∏è **1.21T DXZ minted at TGE, distributed per allocation rules.**  
‚úîÔ∏è **100% of Community Growth unlocked at TGE ‚Üí funds user incentives.**  
‚úîÔ∏è **After exhaustion, 0.75% inflation every 21 days.**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Team & Investors vest gradually to prevent large sell-offs.**  
‚úîÔ∏è **DAO governs Treasury, Ecosystem Funds, & future allocations.**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Liquidity release is controlled by the DAO to align with market conditions.**

---

## **üìå 8. Next Steps**
- ‚úÖ Final Review & Adjustments  
- ‚úÖ Implement in Smart Contracts  
- ‚úÖ Deploy & Secure DAO Oversight

================================================================================
            VESTING EXAMPLE: 60% OF 1000 TOKENS WITH A 30-DAY CLIFF, FULL VEST AT 90 DAYS
            ================================================================================

                // Total slice to vest: 
                uint256 totalAmount = 1000;
                uint256 vestAmt     = (totalAmount * 60) / 100;    // 600 tokens (60% of 1000)

                // Schedule parameters:
                uint64  cliff    = 30 days;   // nothing vests until 30 days after start
                uint64  duration = 90 days;   // linear vest from t=0 ‚Üí t=90 days

            Vested amount over time (via (vestAmt * elapsed) / duration):

                ‚Ä¢ Day 0-29    ‚Üí 0 tokens vested
                ‚Ä¢ Day 30      ‚Üí (600 * 30) / 90 = 200 tokens vested
                ‚Ä¢ Day 60      ‚Üí (600 * 60) / 90 = 400 tokens vested
                ‚Ä¢ Day 90      ‚Üí (600 * 90) / 90 = 600 tokens vested (fully unlocked)
                ‚Ä¢ Day 90+     ‚Üí 600 tokens available (no further vesting)

            To schedule this on-chain:

                dxz.withdrawAndVest(
                    vestingVault,
                    beneficiary,
                    vestAmt,     // 600
                    cliff,       // 30 days
                    duration,    // 90 days
                    revocable    // e.g. false
                );

            After that, the beneficiary can call `vestingVault.releaseVestedTokens(id)` at any time
            to pull out the vested portion according to the above schedule.
