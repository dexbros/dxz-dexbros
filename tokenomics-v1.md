# Dexbros Token Unlocking & Vesting Schedule

## **Version:** 1.0

## **Network:** Ethereum L1 (Supply Governance) + L2 (Utility & Circulation)

---

## **📌 1. Introduction**

Dexbros ($DXZ) follows a structured unlocking and vesting mechanism designed to:

✔️ **Fair & Predictable Distribution** – Prevents token dumping and market instability.  
✔️ **Long-Term Incentive Alignment** – Core contributors, investors, and users benefit gradually.  
✔️ **Governance Oversight** – DAO-managed allocations for sustainability and decentralization.

At TGE (**Token Generation Event**), **1.21 trillion DXZ tokens** are minted on **Ethereum L1**, with controlled releases to **L2** for usage and circulation.

## **📌 2. Token Allocation & Unlocking Summary**

The **initial 1.21 trillion $DxBs** is divided across multiple allocations, each with a distinct vesting and unlocking schedule:

| **Category**                      | **% of Total Supply** | **Tokens (DxBs)** | **Unlocking & Vesting Schedule**                                       |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Private Sale / Seed Investors** | 8%                    | 96.8B             | **20% at TGE, remainder vests monthly over 12 months**                 |
| **Public Sale / IDO / IEO**       | 8%                    | 96.8B             | **25% at TGE, remainder vests linearly over 6 months**                 |
| **Team & Advisors**               | 15%                   | 181.5B            | **12-month cliff, then vests monthly over 36 months**                  |
| **Ecosystem & Partnerships**      | 10%                   | 121B              | **Fully locked at TGE, released via DAO proposals**                    |
| **Community & User Growth**       | 25%                   | 302.5B            | **Fully unlocked at TGE for immediate use**                            |
| **Staking & Validator Rewards**   | 7%                    | 84.7B             | **Gradual emission per block, transitions to inflation-based rewards** |
| **Liquidity & Market Making**     | 10%                   | 121B              | **20% unlocked at TGE, remainder released strategically by DAO**       |
| **Foundation / Treasury**         | 12%                   | 145.2B            | **DAO-controlled, unlocked based on proposals**                        |
| **Unallocated Reserve**           | 5%                    | 60.5B             | **TBD (Governance-controlled usage)**                                  |

## **📌 3. Unlocking & Vesting Details Per Allocation**

### **🔴 Liquidity & Market Making (10%)**
✅ **20% unlocked at TGE.**  
✅ **Remaining 80% is controlled by DAO for strategic release.**  
✅ **Supports liquidity across multiple exchanges (DEX & CEX).**  
✅ **Ensures market stability & prevents excessive volatility.**  

#### **Strategic Release Plan:**
- **DAO votes on liquidity release schedules.**
- **Considerations for multiple exchange listings.**
- **Funds for market-making partnerships to stabilize price action.**

---

## **📌 4. Inflation-Based Minting (Post 25% Depletion)**

📌 Once the **Community & User Growth** pool is depleted:

- **1% inflation of total supply (1.21T DxBs) every 21 days.**
- **Supports staking, validator rewards, social incentives.**

#### **Example Timeline:**

| Cycle   | Total Supply | Inflation (1%) | New Circulating Supply |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Cycle 1 | 1.21T DxBs   | 12.1B DxBs     | 1.2221T DxBs           |
| Cycle 2 | 1.2221T DxBs | 12.22B DxBs    | 1.2343T DxBs           |

## **📌 5. Smart Contract Implementation & Address Registration**

### **Private Sale Unlocking Method:**
🔹 Investors’ addresses **will be registered manually post-deployment.**  
🔹 Smart contract will release tokens based on the **vesting schedule.**  
🔹 DAO can **update investor addresses if required.**  

✅ **Why Manual Registration?**
- Flexibility to add/change investor addresses **after TGE.**  
- Ensures compliance with **legal and KYC requirements.**  
- Allows **strategic token allocations** based on governance decisions.

---

## **📌 6. Governance Control & Adjustments**

✔️ **The DAO can vote to:**  
- Adjust inflation rate (if necessary).  
- Reallocate locked token pools.  
- Burn excess supply to control inflation.  
- Adjust liquidity release schedules based on exchange needs.

## **📌 7. Summary**

✔️ **1.21T DxBs minted at TGE, distributed per allocation rules.**  
✔️ **100% of Community Growth unlocked at TGE → funds user incentives.**  
✔️ **After exhaustion, 1% inflation every 21 days.**  
✔️ **Team & Investors vest gradually to prevent large sell-offs.**  
✔️ **DAO governs Treasury, Ecosystem Funds, & future allocations.**  
✔️ **Liquidity release is controlled by the DAO to align with market conditions.**
